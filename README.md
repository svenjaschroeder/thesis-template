# thesis-template

This LaTeX/LuaLaTeX template is meant for papers written at "Modellierung adaptiver Systeme" (MAS). It can be personalized with options for different types of papers (e.g. bachelor thesis, master thesis, dissertations).

The options are explained in the example `.tex` files.

## Required Software

The latest [Tex Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution for your platform is required. Try to use the official builds, and not the ones that may come with your platforms package management system, as they may be outdated and/or incomplete. Using any other TeX distribution (e.g. MiKTeX) might cause issues as well.

## Generate the PDF

Always try to compile this template with TeX Live's `latexmk` automated builder, don't invoke `pdflatex` or `lualatex` directly! Since we provide a `latexmkrc` file, simply calling:

    latexmk mas-thesis-template.tex

should do the right thing.

## Troubleshooting

- If you change the language, remember to delete all files that were generated by LuaTeX or there will be errors with `babel`

## Should I use chapters or sections?

Use sections.tex if you plan to write a short thesis like a Bachelor Project or a Case Study and ignore chapters for the most past. Chapters.tex is better suited for a Master Thesis or Dissertation because it allows you to divide your thesis better. But nothing stops you to divide your Bachelor Thesis in chapters if you think that it will fit.
